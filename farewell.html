                &emsp;&emsp;For a teenager, four years is definitely a long period. Time flies, as if it is sqeezed into a narrow passage of moments; time will not fly, as if I am paralyzed like Taylor Swift's song. I cannot imagine that I am about to leave one of the most important person in my life.<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;It's simply fortunate to have you during one of the most important times in my life. Right now, I feel like a foreign traveler standing at the intersection, and your guidance is like a map with prospects and a sense of hope. Sometimes, I wonder if you're "brainwashing" me to boost my morale, but your intelligent words have taught me my potential to become more than just an little boy.<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Moreover, for the past four years, you always make everything on the schedule and my parents and I need no worry about troublesome stuffs in the school, which allows me to focus on my studies completely, and I really really appreciate it.

                “ Some people bring you a million blessings,<br>
                Some people teach you a million lessons.<br>
                All that I learned, it wasn't my turn.<br>
                It wasn't the right time.<br>
                Some people come in your life for a reason,<br>
                Others they come in your life for a season ”<br><br>

        <h1>The Destiny</h1>

                &emsp;&emsp;Sometimes, I gaze at the stars and think about the wondrous and enchanting nature of destiny. In the movie “A Wrinkle in Time”, Mrs. Which said, “Do you realize how many events, choices that had to occur since the birth of the universe leading up to the making of you?” Whenever I felt downcast due to failure or parting with my love ones, this line always taught me that all of the things and the people I came across had made who I currently am. We are here in Yangtze because many people made many decisions sequentially, and it must also be a bunch of choices on your leaving. All of the events and decisions lead us to who we are, and I am sure that it is called the destiny.<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;I clearly understand that every decision has its reasoning. As my favorite books "The Alchemist" says " when someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision. " Only after one and half year are we facing the GSAT, and I wish I can share my happiness with you then.

                    “ Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,<br>
                    You were bigger than the whole sky,<br>
                    You were more than just a short time. ”<br><br>

                &emsp;&emsp;I think that it is impossible for you to estimate how much good things and influence you have brought to my life, and I will keep all of them well deep in my mind. Look where we are, we have come so far, and there is still a long long way to go. Thank you for being a fraction of my life, and my heart will be filled with gratefulness when I review all the unforgettable days we share together.</p>
