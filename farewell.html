                &emsp;&emsp;離別總是來的突然，就連這次也不例外。理想混蛋唱過，<a>手中的地圖沒標示方向 ，
                    只有與生俱來的渴望。</a>因此，我之前從舊補習班換到新補習班去時，我的母親便跟我說過，當我們要學的東西不一樣的時候，就會去到不一樣的地方。與其悲傷難過，我想給予感恩與祝福還是最為實際的。怡慧老師您在我生命中的出現，為我帶來了許多能量。在我剛離開國小時，我的心靈其實有一些受傷，直到現在我還在試著調整自己。不過，在您帶的這兩個班上，我找到了可以相信的東西、以及一個不需要每天戰戰兢兢面對的地方。我想沒有了這些，我的人生與未來會截然不同。<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;不久前才剛結束的金曲獎頒獎典禮讓我們見證了音樂所帶來的巨大力量。而我想藉著三首歌，分別是<a

                &emsp;&emsp;For a teenager, four years is definitely a long period. Time flies, as if it is sqeezed into
                a narrow passage of moments; time will not fly, as if I am paralyzed like Taylor Swift's song. I cannot
                imagine that I am about to leave one of the most important person in my life.<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;It's simply fortunate to have you during one of the most important times in my life. Right
                now, I feel like a foreign traveler standing at the intersection, and your guidance is like a map with
                prospects and a sense of hope. Sometimes, I wonder if you're "brainwashing" me to boost my morale, but
                your intelligent words have taught me my potential to become more than just an little boy.<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Moreover, for the past four years, you always make everything on the schedule and my parents
                and I need no worry about troublesome stuffs in the school, which allows me to focus on my studies
                completely, and I really really appreciate it. Therefore, I would like to show my gratefulness through
                these three of my favorite songs.

                    Some people teach you a million lessons.<br>
                    All that I learned, it wasn't my turn.<br>
                    It wasn't the right time.<br>
                    Some people come in your life for a reason,<br>

                &emsp;&emsp;Sometimes, I gaze at the stars and think about the wondrous and enchanting nature of
                destiny. In the movie “A Wrinkle in Time”, Mrs. Which said, “<a>Do you realize how many events, choices
                    that had to occur since the birth of the universe leading up to the making of you?</a>” Whenever I
                felt downcast due to failure or parting with my love ones, this line always taught me that all of the
                things and the people I came across had made who I currently am. We are here in Yangtze because many
                people made many decisions sequentially, and it must also be a bunch of choices on your leaving. All of
                the events and decisions lead us to who we are, and I am sure that it is called the destiny.<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;I clearly understand that every decision has its reasoning. As my favorite books "The
                Alchemist" says "<a> when someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will
                    carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision. </a>" Only after one
                and half year are we facing the GSAT, and I wish I can share my happiness with you then.

                    You were bigger than the whole sky,<br>
                    You were more than just a short time. ”<br><br>

                &emsp;&emsp;Honestly, my words are not capable to thoroughly represent my complicated feelings. You give
                me courage, teaching us how to learn English through taking notes and underlining important usages in
                the textbook ,and even showing me the direction of every possibility. There are more than these, which
                make it impossible to mention everything in one time. I'll definitely miss our excellent wallpapers, our
                glories, and everything we've done.<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;I think that it is impossible for you to estimate how much good things and influence you
                have brought to my life, and I will keep all of them well deep in my mind. <a>Look where we are, we have
                    come so far, and there is still a long long way to go.</a>(This used to be my favorite song when I
                was little, but now it gets a deeper meanings and contains countless fantastic memories.) Thank you for
                being a fraction of my life, and my heart will be filled with gratefulness when I review all the
                unforgettable days we share together.<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Finally, feel free if you'd like to visit us on our activities such as campus carnival and
                sports competition, and please accept best wishes with all my heart. Bon voyage!
