Once upon a time, there was a brave knight who lived in a castle made of crystal.
The knight had a magical sword that could cut through shadows and reveal hidden truths.
Every morning, he would ride his silver horse through the enchanted forest nearby.

One day, he discovered a mysterious cave glowing with blue light.
Inside the cave, he found a dragon who was not fierce at all, but rather loved to read books.
The knight and the dragon became unlikely friends, sharing stories and drinking tea together.
Soon, other magical creatures began visiting their cave for weekly book club meetings.
Word spread throughout the kingdom about the reading dragon and the literary knight.
The kingdom became known as a place where magic and knowledge lived in harmony.
And so, they all lived happily ever after, surrounded by books and magic.

Welcome to DialogJS! Let's explore how to create interactive stories.

First, to display a command in text, use [[]]. For example: [[]show] prints the command.
Let me demonstrate basic commands:
[[]show] - Shows the dialog box
[[]hide] - Hides the dialog box
[[]n] - Creates a new line

Let's customize our appearance:
[setting Arial #FFFFFF #333333 none]
[[]setting font-family color dialog-bg-color dialog-bg-img] changes the look

Time for some media commands!
[bg sunset.jpg cover]
[[]bg source fit-style] changes the background

[img bocchi bocchi.jpg 20 20 1 300 300 true]
[[]img name src x y z width height show] displays images
[move bocchi 50 50 1]
[[]move name deltaX deltaY time(s)] moves images
[scale bocchi 1.2 1.8 1]
[[]scale name deltaX deltaY time(s)] scales images
[skew bocchi 20 10 1]
[[]skew degX degY time(s)] skews images
[rotate bocchi 40 1]
[[]rotate deg time(s)] rotates images

[audio bgm Music.mp3 play 30 2000]
[[]audio name src play time fade] plays music

Let's try the variable system:
[[]setVar name value] sets a variable
[setVar playerName "Explorer"]
[[]showVar name] displays a variable
Hello, [showVar playerName]!

[[]input varname prompt] gets user input
[input favPlace "What's your favorite place?"]
You like [showVar favPlace]? That's wonderful!

[bg resize.jpg contain]

Character dialogue works like this:
[[]speaker isvariable name] sets the speaker
[speaker false Guide]
I'm your guide!
[speaker true playerName]
Now you're speaking!
press `l` to read previous dialog.

Let's change scenes...

Time to learn about choices:
[[]button filename text] creates a choice
[[]showbutton] displays all choices
Where would you like to go?
[button story.txt Begin Adventure]
[button none Continue Demo]
[showbutton]
Use [[]goto filename] to jump between files.
[goto demo.txt]

[hide]
