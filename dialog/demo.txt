One day, he discovered a mysterious cave glowing with blue light.
Inside the cave, he found a dragon who was not fierce at all, but rather loved to read books.
The knight and the dragon became unlikely friends, sharing stories and drinking tea together.
Soon, other magical creatures began visiting their cave for weekly book club meetings.
Word spread throughout the kingdom about the reading dragon and the literary knight.
The kingdom became known as a place where magic and knowledge lived in harmony.
And so, they all lived happily ever after, surrounded by books and magic.
